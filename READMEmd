## Required Software

- Docker

## Starting The Dev App

- Clone the app to your local system
- In /agilearning-plugin, run "npm run install-dependencies" in the terminal.
- In /agilearning-plugin/client, add an .env file with these parameters:
  - VITE_API_PORT=3001
  - VITE_PORT=3000
- In /agilearning-plugin/server, add an .env file with these parameters:

  - PORT=3001
  - DB_HOST=localhost
  - DB_USER=root
  - DB_PASSWORD=password
  - DB_NAME=agilearning-api

- In /agilearning-plugin/server, ensuring Docker is running, run "npm run create-db" in the terminal
  - confirm a new container named agilearning-mysql has been created and is running.
- After that, still in /server, run "npm run migrate:up".

To actually run the app, in the /agilearning-plugin terminal, run "npm run start".
